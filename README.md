# Covid19Mouse-Itsy
 
Assigned worked at home during confinement but want to work on props ? 
A simple mouse move simulator. Turns your arduino into a mouse that moves a little at random times. Needs a native USB port on the MCU, use a leonardo (or any ATmega32u4 board, including the Arduino micro), or the newer ARM32 based duino boards such as the ItsyBitsy from Adafruit.
